# Pipe and Filter Pattern Implementation in Java

![Java](https://img.shields.io/badge/Java-17+-blue.svg)

A clean implementation of the Pipe and Filter architectural pattern using Java functional programming features.

## Overview

This project demonstrates the Pipe and Filter pattern, where data flows through a series of processing steps (filters) connected by pipes. Each filter transforms the data and passes it to the next filter in the pipeline.

## Features

- ğŸš€ Modular pipeline processor
- ğŸ”„ Chainable filter operations
- âš¡ Java Stream API integration
- ğŸ“Š Multiple built-in filters:
  - Even number filter
  - Square numbers transformer
  - Multiplication filter
  - Threshold filter
- Easy to extend with new filters
